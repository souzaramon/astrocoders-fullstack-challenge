# Astrocoders Fullstack Challenge

Hi, thank you for taking on our challenge! We hope that you'll learn a lot, create an awesome project and join the Astrocoders team.

In this test, we will evaluate the knowledge you already have about ReactJS and your ability to learn new technologies. In order to complete it, you must develop a Gmail interface that loads the last 40 (forty) tweets containing the **#mars** hashtag and enables the user to filter them using the search box.

## Please check:

1. The interface that is in the [Layout](#layout) section (which already is simpler than the normal one, of course);
2. The Twitter API (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index.html);
3. The Technical Requisites for your preferred technology that are listed just below.

2. Ramda (https://ramdajs.com);
3. styled-components (https://styled-components.com);
